# tfstate
Restful Terraform remote state server

Refer to the Documentation [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote/http.html) on how to setup your terraform to talk to a resftful server
Currently this only supports saving the State to MongoDB after the Restful server receives it, but you can have more implementations.
Look at mongo.go for a Sample implementation and storeage.go is the basic interface that every engine needs to implement.

Make sure your GOPATH and all is set.
